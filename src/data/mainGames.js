        description: `
        Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the first game in the
        Wizardry series of role-playing video games. It was developed by Andrew
        Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. In 1980, Norman Sirotek formed Sir-Tech
        Software, Inc. and launched a beta version of the product at the 1980
        Boston Computer Convention. The final version of the game was released
        in USA in 1981 and in Japan in 1985.

        Also available for the PC Engine as part of Wizardry I + II (1993), for the Super Famicom as part of Wizardry I-II-III: Story of Llylgamyn (1999), and for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn as part of Wizardry: Llylgamyn Saga (1998).

        The game was one of the first Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing
        games to be written for computer play, and the first such game to offer
        color graphics.

        The Return of Werdna is the fourth scenario in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games. 
        It was published in 1987 by Sir-Tech Software, Inc. It was later ported on home consoles, such as the PC Engine CD and the PlayStation, through the Wizardry: New Age of Llylgamyn compilation. 
        The game begins at the bottom of a 10-level dungeon. Most of Werdna's powers are depleted and must be gradually recovered throughout the game. The initial goal is to climb to the top of the dungeon, reclaiming Werdna's full power along the way. Each level has one or more pentagrams at specific points. 
        Instead of fighting monsters, the player fights against the heroes from the past three Wizardry games. Players of the first three games who sent their character disks to Sir-Tech might have their characters present in Wizardry IV.

        While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features.

        Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh title in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games by Sir-Tech Software, Inc.
        The game is notable for featuring an early example of a well developed diplomacy mechanic. It features multiple competing factions with different interests in the world of Guardia.
        Crusaders of the Dark Savant is played from a first person perspective, with the party's character portraits visible alongside what they see in the game world, and movement is tile-based, and the player can only turn in 90° increments. The game supported contemporary VGA displays and a variety of sound cards for effects, and synthesized background music. The player could use the mouse or keyboard to navigate the user interface.

        Wizardry 8 is the last installment in the Wizardry series of role-playing video games developed by Sir-Tech Canada. Serving as the third game in the "Dark Savant trilogy".
        Originally published in 2001 by Sir-Tech, it was later re-released by Night Dive Studios on GOG.com and Steam in 2013.
        The basic gameplay system is similar to the previous entries in the series: the player-controlled party of up to six characters roams the world viewed from a first-person perspective, completes quests and fights enemies to gain experience and become stronger. Unlike those, however, Wizardry 8 has a real 3D environment.
