### Inspiration

I came across a bunch of online pictures of a card game from the 1990s, and after doing some extensive research, I stumbled upon the new universe of [Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry) and the artist [Jun Suemi / 末弥 純](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%AB%E5%BC%A5%E7%B4%94). So, I decided to put together this simple gallery with the coolest information I could find.
